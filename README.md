# four-vector-analysis
An evalution task for MadAnalysis5 and learn the involved concepts.

The code structure of this project is
- `main.h` contains all necessary computational classes and functions.
- `main.cpp` contains user interaction with required inputs as a program. 
- `test.cpp` contains unit tests to test the working of the functions written in `main.h`. 
- `input.dat` is the sample data which has been gven for the evalution task and has to be utilized inside the program as input.
- `test.dat` is the sample test data for running unit tests in `test.cpp`.


Also, The Github workflow is set up to run the test cases and check if they fails or succeeds.
